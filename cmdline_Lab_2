#Getting started with App Engine
##Learning Objectives

    Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
    Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
    Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

##Steps
1.Verify active accounts and credentials from command line

    gcloud auth list
    gcloud config list project
    
2.Initialize App Engine

    gcloud app create -- project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
#select region as appropraite when prompted
#14(us-central1)

#Clone source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory.

    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples
    cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world       #Navigate to source directory
    
#Run hello_world application locally

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install virtualenv                                     #setup environment to run application
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate                                            #Activate the virtual environment
    pip install  -r requirements.txt
    python main.py                                                      #Run App
#ctrl + c to end test

3. Deploy and run hello_world on App Engine

    cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world     #Navigate to the source dir
    gcloud app deploy  
    gcloud app browse                                                   #go to link to see app (https://qwiklabs-gcp-04-121f1d2b4ad7.uc.r.appspot.com)
    
    exit
